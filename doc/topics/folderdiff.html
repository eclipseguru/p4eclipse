<h1>Comparing Folders Using Folder Diff</h1>
<p>The P4Eclipse folder diff feature enables you to recursively compare two paths or two revisions of the same  path to display how the contents have changed. Folder diff indicates files that were added, changed or deleted, and includes tabs that display statistics about user activity (author chart), activity on a per-filetype basis (content type chart), and activity on a per-project basis (project chart tab).
<p>Folder diff uses color coding to distinguish unique files and content from files and content that simply differ between the specified paths. To configure the color coding, go to <strong>Preferences&gt;Team&gt;Perforce&gt;Folder Diff</strong>. To display the differences between two files, context-click one of the files and choose <strong>Diff Against Pair</strong>.</p>
